[{"34": "It sounds like you've hit on a common challenge with Reddit \u2013 it's an incredible platform for finding people actively discussing problems your product solves, but the line for self-promotion is very fine and easy to cross. Your strategy of only answering threads where people ask for solutions is exactly right for avoiding bans. \n\nOne thing that often works well is focusing less on the 'tool' aspect and more on solving the underlying problem. Instead of thinking 'I need to promote my scheduling tool,' think 'How can I genuinely help someone who is struggling with scheduling back-and-forth?' \n\nFor Reddit specifically, beyond direct replies, you could try:\n\n1.  **Observing and learning:** Spend time in relevant subreddits just reading, upvoting, and commenting on discussions *without* any intent to promote. This helps you understand the community's language, pain points, and acceptable norms.\n2.  **Providing general value:** Share insights, best practices, or personal experiences related to productivity, meeting management, or communication, without linking back to your product. Over time, if you establish yourself as a helpful voice, people might naturally check out your profile or previous comments.\n3.  **Search optimization:** Think about the keywords people use when they're *frustrated* with scheduling. 'Calendar nightmare,' 'too many emails for a simple meeting,' 'scheduling fatigue.' Look for these phrases rather than just 'scheduling tool.'\n\nThere are tools that help automate the discovery of these 'pain point' conversations, like Mention, Brandwatch, or Leadlee, which can save a ton of time sifting through Reddit manually. But regardless of the tools, the core strategy remains the same: provide genuine value first, and any product mention should be a natural extension of that help."}, {"47": "Starting a creative agency for startups is an exciting venture! You're asking all the right questions, especially around getting those first clients and managing growth.\n\nFor landing your first 5-10 clients, here are a few strategies that have proven effective for agencies in the early stages:\n\n1.  **Niche Down Aggressively:** Instead of 'startups and small businesses,' consider an even tighter niche initially, e.g., 'SaaS startups in the FinTech space' or 'DTC e-commerce startups under $1M ARR.' This makes your marketing message sharper and helps you become the go-to expert faster.\n2.  **Warm Introductions & Networking:** Leverage your personal and professional network. Let everyone know what you're doing. Attend virtual and local startup events, pitch competitions, and co-working spaces. Founders often trust referrals from people they know.\n3.  **Content Marketing & Thought Leadership:** Create valuable content (blog posts, short videos, case studies) that addresses the specific branding and advertising challenges your target startups face. Position yourself as a problem-solver. Share this on LinkedIn, relevant subreddits, or industry forums.\n4.  **Community Engagement:** Actively participate in online communities where your target founders hang out (e.g., specific subreddits, Slack groups, industry forums). Answer questions, offer advice, and demonstrate your expertise without explicitly selling. Over time, this builds trust and visibility. Tools like Hootsuite for social listening or Leadlee for identifying relevant community discussions can help streamline this process, but the human touch is key.\n5.  **Small Pilot Projects/Pro-Bono (Selectively):** Offer to do a small, high-impact branding audit or a mini-project for a promising startup in exchange for a glowing testimonial and case study. Choose carefully to ensure it's a good fit and will generate strong social proof.\n\nFor pricing, a common approach is value-based pricing, but that can be tricky with early-stage startups. Consider tiered packages (e.g., 'Brand Foundation,' 'Growth Package') that offer clear deliverables and outcomes. This helps startups see the value and makes it easier for them to choose based on their budget and needs."}]
