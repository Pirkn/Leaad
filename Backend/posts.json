Since your site is already built on Squarespace, the easiest and cleanest option is to just use Squarespace\u2019s built-in Commerce tools. You don\u2019t need to switch to Shopify unless you really want to. Squarespace lets you add a Shop page, upload products, manage inventory, and take payments all within the same platform, which keeps things simple and cohesive. You can just add a \u201cShop\u201d button to your navigation, and build it out from there if that help.\n\nAs for your existing listings on Facebook and Mercari, there\u2019s no direct copy-paste function that will move all your products over automatically.

The key thing to understand is that general liability insurance is usually based on your gross revenue, unless you can clearly separate out subcontractor costs and prove those subs carry their own liability insurance by themselves (with valid COIs). So even though your P&L shows vendor income and expense separately, the insurer will still count all of it as revenue unless you document those subs properly.\n\nWhen the audit form asks for a single \"revenue\" number, you can still submit an explanation alongside it, show your gross revenue, then subtract out what you paid to insured subcontractors, and include their COIs. This way,i bet you\u2019re showing the adjusted exposure they should be basing your premium on. It\u2019s also a good idea to check with your broker, they can often help present it correctly to avoid overpaying.\n\nSo it\u2019s not just about how your P&L is structured, but more about how you present the info during the audit with good documentation, you should be able to lower your premium going forward."}]}, {"post_id": 9, "title": "Business logo", "score": 1, "total_comments": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mq54qb/", "content": "Hello.
