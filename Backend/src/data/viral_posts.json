Who would even pay for it?\n\nBut last night, as I was about to go to bed, I got the notification. You know the one – \"You've received a payment of [amount].\" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.\n\nWhat My Product Does\n\nThe product [product description].\n\nIt’s aimed at [who your product is meant for]. And clearly, there’s at least one person out there who saw enough value to subscribe!\n\nWhy This Means So Much to Me\n\nI’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This [sale amount] is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nFor me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.\n\nThanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other. 🚀\n\nYou can check my product here: [product URL]\"",

        "originalPostText": "Hi, guys. I want to share my story with you.\n\nI've built 4 different saas projects in the past. one of them made around $600 MRR, but i was still working a 9-5 job at the time. that made it really hard to focus on the product and talk to users properly.\n\nIn february, i quit my job to go full-time on my own projects. that same saas made $1300 in march. but during march, i also started working on a new idea.\n\nThis new project is called Indie Hunt. it’s basically a product hunt alternative, but for indie makers. i made it because product hunt became a nightmare for indie projects. whether it’s tech influencers or big company launches, indie products keep getting buried. even if your product is great, it barely gets attention.\n\nI tweeted about the idea. even though i don’t have a big following, the response was great. i realized i had something worth building. other “indie-friendly” launch platforms had 2-month waiting-line, or asked for $10-90 just to get listed. i wanted to build a place where makers don’t wait, don’t pay up front, and can discovered by other indie makers.\n\nSo i built it. on april 1st, i launched it. no launch on any platform. just one tweet.\n\n14 people signed up on day one and added their products.\n\nThe next morning i posted about it on reddit. and that changed everything. over 60 users, more than 40 products, and my first paying customer.\n\nPlatform was new, so i offered a 3-day free trial for the “featured” section. tweeted about that too. since then, i’ve been sharing stats every day and talking to users constantly on twitter.\n\nToday is 8th day after launch. the platform now has 15+ paying customers, 150+ products, and 200+ users. a few well-known makers joined too.\n\nI’m building it in public, improving it daily with feedback, and just trying to make something useful.\n\nHope this story helps someone who's on a similar path.",

I wasn’t expecting much (with all of the bad rep it got in the last months) —I just wanted to put it out there and see what happens.\n\nHere’s what the launch has looked like so far:\n\n- 291 upvotes on Product Hunt.\n\n- 360 website visits, resulting in 85 app downloads.\n\n- And most exciting of all: 20 paying users already -> this exceeded my expectation by miles\n\nEasyChef was born out of a personal need.

I found myself turning to ChatGPT for recipe ideas, but the process of manually listing ingredients and tweaking prompts felt tedious. That’s when I decided to create something better.\n\nThe app is simple:\n\n- You input ingredients you have (or dietary preferences).\n\n- It generates personalized recipes instantly.\n- It remembers your preferences over time to improve suggestions.\n\n- And it keeps everything beginner-friendly with easy-to-follow steps.\n\nThe response so far has been encouraging, and while 20 paying users might not sound like a lot, it feels like a huge milestone for me.\n\nIf you’ve been sitting on an idea, wondering if it’s worth launching, my advice would be to give it a try.

Our criteria:\n\nExisting competitors: Proof there’s demand.\n\nMinimum $1M ARR potential: No small markets but the cake is always big enough to get your piece\n\nQuick MVP: Buildable in 2 weeks.\n\nPersonal fit: A problem we care about solving.\n\nStep 2: Use these strategies to find ideas\n\nListen to what people are asking for: Search for phrases like \"What tools do you use for...?\", \"Is there software that does this?\", or \"How do you solve...?\" on Reddit and other forums. These are goldmines for uncovering gaps in existing solutions. Communities often share workarounds or frustrations that point directly to market opportunities. Tools like GummySearch can help you filter relevant subreddits and posts.\n\nFollow the money: Dive into platforms like Upwork to uncover challenges businesses are actively paying to solve. Look for recurring requests in areas like automation, analytics, workflow optimization, or niche tools for specific industries. If you see patterns in what people are hiring for, you've likely found a problem worth solving.\n\nExplore startup directories: Look at directories from startup accelerators like Y Combinator or techstars. They often reveal interesting niches that are underserved or just starting to grow.\n\nCold outreach: Pick a target audience and reach out directly via email. Offer to build a solution for a specific problem they have. Then, validate it further by contacting more people in the same niche to see if it’s a common pain point.\n\nTrending products: Monitor platforms like Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, and Trends(.)vc for products that are gaining traction. Often, you’ll spot recurring themes or underserved verticals. Even better, look for comments like “This is great, but I wish it did XYZ.” That’s your gap to fill.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\nThe hardest part isn’t the idea itself—it’s staying committed and digging deep enough to understand the problem you're solving.",

        "originalPostText": "[picture of stripe notification]\n    \n    Hey everyone,\n\nA few weeks ago, I was deep in the frustration of job hunting. It felt like I was sending my resume into a black hole. You get the generic rejection email, but you never know the real reason why.\n\nThat's when I had an idea: what if there was a tool that told you what recruiters won't? A tool that gives you the brutally honest feedback you need to actually improve?\n\nSo, I built Aplycat. My goal for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was to create a tool that could:\n\nAnalyze your resume or LinkedIn profile with zero sugar-coating. It points out every flaw and weak spot.\n\nInstantly generate an improved version of your resume based on that feedback.\n\nOptimize your resume AND cover letter specifically for any job URL you provide.\n\nEnsure your resume is ATS-friendly to get past the initial screening bots. The response has been incredible. I launched 24 hours ago and already have my first paying customer, which is just mind-blowing. For the future, I'm planning to build out a feature that completely automates the job search and application process. I built this to solve my own problem, and I hope it can help some of you too. I'd love for you to check it out and hear your honest feedback. Link: https://www.aplycat.com/",
