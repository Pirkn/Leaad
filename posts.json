I brought in a partner to help who has been essentially a COO (instrumental in opening a second location). I offered him profits interest. He is uncertain if he wants to do it long-term. I want to incentivize him to stay, while also protecting myself if he leaves.\n\nContract is good except I have questions about a buyback clause. What is typical? He gets time based equity (5% a year up to 25%). Assume I could sell my business to PE for 6-12x multiple (likely 8-10) of EBITDA.\n\nIf he leaves after 2 years, for example, (and has vested 10%), is it fair to be conservative and assume FMV is 6x multiple of EBITDA? Or if I am confident in 8x-10x is that more appropriate? If 8-10 is more fair, would a 10-20% discount be plausible? Or is all this determined by a 3rd party?\n\nNew to this. Hired a lawyer but wanting more opinions from those who may have been in similar situation.\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        1.

And it's ok if you budget some amount of time to unknowns as well. Once you get signoff on the plans, this will empower you to say no and to push back. Basically you want to be able to do the following:\n\n* Have a plan you can share. Often leaders treat you like this when they don't know that things are already in motion. Being able to say \"this is already on the docket for September\" will free up your entire August. Being able to say \"we do this reporting monthly, and I can either give you last month's or you can wait a week until next month's\" will save tons of ad-hoc requests. Having and communicating the plan - even if it's just a \"plan to plan\" for distant months, will add a lot of calm.\n* Have time allocated to resolve urgent issues. This means planning out 60% or 80% of your time for the month/quarter/year, but leaving the rest open (but that open time must be scheduled in advance). You do not take same-day requests - if they cannot plan, it is not on you to accommodate their lack of foresight.\n* Have an integrated view of marketing that's covered across the organization and is not just addressing the squeaky wheel internally. You need a comprehensive plan rather than just individual, one-off, and siloed attempts.\n* Develop processes for requests and changes. Formalize it - especially for this person. Ask to submit a ticket, fill out a template, or whatever else. Make them structure the request in a way that makes it easier for you to take it and work on it. This will also reduce the volume of requests and increase the quality of requests (and give you a lot more documentation about the requests as well in case you need more headcount, etc)\n* Hold to the plan. Not rigidly, but when things get added, take something else off. If this VP wants to be the priority, let them get permission to override the plan. Make them negotiate. You will say \"we've already planned X, Y, Z for this time. Can you please coordinate with those teams on which should take priority.\" You cannot and should not do everything. Once you have a plan and buy-in from your management, this VP will have to discuss with your manager for changes.\n3. Score: 5 | Comment: It's a good thing that you're having a planning meeting.
