Trying to lose weight without it is like trying to manage your budget without looking at your bank statement. It's not impossible but it makes everything a lot less quantifiable. \n\nIf you really can't do it for mental health reasons, you should be working with a registered dietician to figure out alternative methods to reduce caloric intake. It is extremely possible and honestly pretty easy to exceed your daily caloric intake eating \"healthy\" foods when you're in a deficit. \n\nIf you don't *like* doing it....well, nobody does. It sucks. But if you have the option you should strongly consider it as it's the single best tool to help reduce weight.\n\nThe reality is, at your current weight simple lifestyle changes most likely will result in some weight loss, so that's good news.

I'm 100lbs down from 250 and lost down to around 200-ish before I had to go from \"better diet\" to strict calorie counting.\n\nAgain, you should speak with a dietician either way, but if you truly can't calorie count that will need to be an ongoing relationship as what your habits look like will need to evolve along with your weight loss.\n2.

Score: 6 | Comment: Soaking your beans before cooking them is the main effective tool. Beans contain sugars that some people can't break down effectively. By soaking the beans, you dissolve those sugars out of the beans into the water and then dump the water. It doesn't get all of it, but it gets a lot of it.\n\nThere are two primary methods for doing this. I researched it a while back and the \"fast\" method is supposedly the most effective.\n\nThe slow method is simply put the beans in water for 24 hours. And that's good. But if you boil the beans for about 2 minutes and leave them covered to sit for an hour, that will extract more of the sugars than just soaking for 24 hours. You can, of course, combine the two.   \n  \nYou could do the fast method, dispose of the water after the hour, then add fresh water and soak for 24 hours. Or multiple fast soaks, using fresh water each time.\n\nBut beyond that, nothing else that I know of is going to reduce those sugars.\n\nTaking beano provides you with more of the enzyme for people who don't produce enough.\n3.

Score: 1 | Comment: Sugar - carbs - is easy energy, preferred by the body instead of energy made from fat (ketones). As you fast, your glucose stores from your body get used up, and the body sends strong signals for eating more carbs. If you don't give in and keep fasting and/or eating a low carb diet, in a few days, body switches to using fat for energy (making ketones), and carb cravings should almost go away. Then, it's up to you to differentiate between actual hunger/need for energy and just cravings, and to stop yourself from indulging in chocolate bars. It's really like quitting drugs, and it can be as hard. \n\nYou say you don't typically crave sweets, but not all carbs are sweet. Rice is fast carbs, so is all (most?) grains, some veggies are high in carbs, beans, legumes, bread, pasta, also fruit and berries... My guess is, sweets associates easier with quick easy energy, so we crave sugary stuff rather than a bowl of beans... Or a pizza... But it depends xD\n\nYou can reduce carb cravings and make fasting easier by sticking to a low carb diet, like keto, for a few weeks... You can even stuff your face with keto foods until you can't fit in anything anymore, if that stops you from eating chocolate, and wean yourself off fast carbs that way... And then just... Don't fall back into old patterns, and if you do, you now have tools to get out. \ud83d\ude05 \n\nAnd no one needs sugar! \ud83d\ude05 Sugar is very unhealthy! Choose complex carbs instead!
