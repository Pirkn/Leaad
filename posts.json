It has also been helpful for categorizing reviews by use case or buyer type, something that was way too time-consuming to do manually.\n\nWhat has been harder than expected:\nGetting AI outputs to be context-aware without going off-track.

We learned early that you can\u2019t just \u201cset it and forget it\u201d, AI needs clear rules, good source data, and human review.

In Search Console, \u201cInspect URL\u201d and fetch the homepage to confirm it\u2019s rendering correctly. Make sure the canonical tag points to itself.\n* You\u2019ve already boosted internal linking,  now get a few *fresh, external* backlinks to your homepage using branded or partial-match anchors. Ask partners or industry sites for quick inclusions. Also, update 1\u20132 high-authority pages with fresh content that links back to your homepage and product page.\n* Update your About page, client logos, or case studies. Add or update schema markup so Google clearly sees your homepage as the main brand hub. Slip your main keyword naturally into the first 100 words of the homepage.\n* Avoid overloading with new links and keyword stuffing; sudden big changes can slow recovery. Google values stability after a shake-up.\n* Write a new blog post targeting your main keyword, link prominently to your homepage, and share it widely. Even one or two external links to that post can help.\n\nYou\u2019ve fixed the root problem, now focus on stable, relevant signals and a bit of fresh link activity.

However, all iOS apps that I found were either bloated, cost money, or did not offer iOS Files app integration. That's when I decided to build Zettel: an ultra-minimalistic note-taking app.\n\nWith Zettel, you can:\n\n* quickly take notes on a virtual Zettel\n* swipe to save\n* use tags to organize\n\nZettel automatically syncs your saved notes via the iOS Files app, so you can access them anywhere you want (e.g. from Obsidian). The app itself is 1MB and free & open-source.\n\nI use Zettel daily to capture thoughts, ideas, or simply keep track of my to-dos; since every Zettel is just a simple markdown file, it integrates with my Obsidian vault\n\nHere's the App Store link, so you can download it for free: [Zettel - Quick Notes](https://apps.apple.com/app/zettel-quick-notes/id6748525244)\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        ==============================", "\n            === POST 88 ===\n            Title: I'm looking for a team for MMORPG game\n            Score: 1 upvotes\n            Total Comments: 1\n            URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mnb4yw/\n            Content: No text\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        1.

The hope is to purchase one at some point this year.\n\nI've read a lot of books on the topic and several mention \"second-lien\" financing from a seller for the downpayment requirement.\n\nHow it's supposed to work is if I borrow 1 million dollars via SBA loan I can have the seller only accept 900,000 and then start charging interest on the remaining 100,000. Once the SBA loan is paid off I start repayment (including the interest earned) on the remaining 100k to the seller.\n\nThis means I'm only out of pocket for attorney and accountant fees etc (plus closing cost).\n\nIs this common or actually realistic?\n\nThanks!\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        1.
