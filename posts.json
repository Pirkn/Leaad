Score: 2 | Comment: What a great question. The answer will slightly depend on the type of company: if you read some of the \"classic\" product books but you work in a big, old enterprise company then not much of what you read is going to fit what you actually work with day to day. If your company is much smaller, the team might be more strategic but things will probably be more chaotic as the team is trying to find what's called product-market fit. If you work at a bank then \"product management\" might look more like old-school \"project management\".  \n\nDefinitely ask the product manager, or if there's a head of product ask them. Most product people should be happy to talk through how they see the lie of the land, explain what they see their role as, and talk you through roughly what their day looks like. \n\nTo start you off, [Atlassian has a video called \"what is product management\" embedded on this page](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management) which is a decent, short explainer of some of the concepts. It's a bit light heavy on the delivery side of the role and light on the strategy side, but once you've ascertained what sort of product team you're working with you can lean on learning resources in that direction.\n2. Score: 2 | Comment: I have 20+ years of experience working in product and from painful experience, i can tell you there is only one good way:\n\nstart talking to everyone. Have them explain what they do, the roles and processes. Use the \"i am new\" card to the maximum. \n\nWhy? Because in general, companies love to re-name roles and people are kind of bad at implementing frameworks and processes.\n\nWhen you think about what product management is at its very core, it is SIMPLE:\n\nYou have to answer the question \"Who do we serve and how do we generate value?\"\n\nWho: Market Segments, Target Audience, Personas etc.  \nValue: start with the pain (the world without the product) and match it with the gain/pain reliever (the world with the product)\n\nNow the team has to  \n1. collects or generates ideas how to generate (more) value called Opportunities: \"If we provide feature X then the user gets that benefit from it\"  \n2. decide what to work on (prioritize)  \n3. turn opportunities into work items (what to do)   \n4. implement work items  \n5. Analyse the impact, learn and improve the value model (who do we serve, how do we create value)\n\nrinse and repeat :-)\n\nStep 1+2 is called discovery  \nStep 3+4 is delivery  \nStep 5 is usually skipped\n\nFor Discovery, you should check out \"Continuous Discovery Habits\" by Teresa Torres\n\nFor Delivery, you have to get the basics of flow control. Either the team works in iterations (Scrum Framework Sprint Idea) or continuously (Kanban). What makes it a bit confusing is that within an iteration the team usually also using Kanban Boards and some of its rules. \n\nFor Delivery, check out Scrum and Kanban. If you work in Software, you have to understand the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle). \n\nThats pretty much it. \n\nMost products team are somewhere on a scale between \"Focus on throughput of Features (Feature Factory)\" and \"Focus on Value generated (Impact Driven)\".\n\nBased on my very extensive research in the agile community in europe, i would argue that 95% of product teams have no clear/aligned definition of who they serve and what problem the product solves. It seems to me that effective discovery is done by maybe 5-10% of teams. Most teams skip out on the part, because they simply don\u00b4t know how to do it, get no capacity for it and leadership does not prioritize evidence-based value generation. \n\nSo when you learn about it, you might focus on delivery and the biggest issue for management: predictability of output: when will the feature be ready and will it work as expected?\n\nI love working in product and it is the best job in the world. It is a privilege to work with very smart and kind people and getting stuff done feels amazing. So i hope you will enjoy your new role and the team will appreciate you ;-)\n3.

Score: 1 | Comment: Purchased moving leads suck because they're sold to multiple companies and people get bombarded with calls immediately. Working at an outreach company, our moving company clients who succeed focus on speed and value, not just making contact.\n\nCall within 5 minutes of getting the lead, not hours later. First company to reach them usually wins because people make moving decisions fast when they're stressed about relocating.\n\nDon't just ask for their business on the first call. Instead, position yourself as a moving consultant who's helping them understand their options. Ask questions about timeline, inventory, budget concerns, previous moving experiences. Build trust before pitching services.\n\nAlso, most people buying leads don't follow up properly. One call and done is stupid. Follow up 3-4 times over a week because moving timelines change and people comparison shop before deciding.\n\nFor lead quality, ask providers about exclusivity and lead age. Non-exclusive leads where you're competing with 5 other companies are usually waste of money. Leads older than 24 hours are basically worthless in moving industry.\n\nBetter approach is building your own lead generation through Google Ads, local SEO, and referral programs. More work upfront but way better quality than purchased leads.\n\nWhat's your current close rate on purchased leads and how quickly are you responding to new ones?\n2. Score: 1 | Comment: I definitely say follow up is key. As you said some of these leads can actually be really solid, the problem is that several people need multiple interactions with a product before they buy. It isn't necessarily because they don't want to buy from you but more of they have a whole lot of other things on their mind. Potentially you need to lower your amount of leads coming in and give some more follow up.
