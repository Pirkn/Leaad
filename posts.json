We built one 1080x1920 master in After Effects, exposed location, price, and CTA fields in Essential Graphics, then pointed a CSV at it with ExtendScript-hit run and it spits 200 unique renders overnight, all branded and consistent. For hyper-local slang a Google Sheet column maintained by regional managers writes the lower-third text, so the creative team never guesses. Descript cleans up any VO tweaks quickly, Later\u2019s bulk uploader schedules the files by region, and AdComposer AI spits out the location-specific captions so nobody touches a blank doc. If you don\u2019t want to script, Kapwing\u2019s Replace Media and Variable Text get you 80 % there, just slower.
