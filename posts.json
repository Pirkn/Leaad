I also will apply directly on a company site if given an option too.  Indeed is the most straightforward one that I've found that is easy enough to send out a bunch of applications at once.  I have my most current resume, and a few different cover letters ready to copy and paste depending on the type of job I'm applying for.  \n\nI will average maybe 3 or 4 interviews a week, with about half of those being over the phone or Zoom.  Being that I want to get into a higher management position, I expect to have more than one interview.  Usually the first with the store manager or district manager, and the next with someone higher up in corporate.  Rarely do I ever get a 2nd interview.   I've had the most luck with two job recruiting companies.  Both were able to get me up to the 3rd and 4th round of interviews.  I was very hopeful for both of them, but they ended up passing on me.  What's most frustrating is that they don't give any reason.  I would honestly like some constructive feedback on where I may be going wrong.  Am I talking too much?  Did I say the wrong word?  \n\nI always dress in a suit and tie when going to an interview, even if it was on Zoom.  I want to look as presentable as possible.  I bring a notebook where I have a synopsis of my work history above that I reference, as well as notes about the company I can bring up so I appear knowledgeable about their brand.  Also a list of questions to ask if they aren't covered.  I plan on at least 30 minutes to an hour for my interviews, unless the interviewer has a different time frame they notified me on.  I have a genuine smile and happy demeanor, which honestly does come naturally to me, because I do enjoy what I do.\n\nIf asked my strengths, I bring up my ability to create a positive restaurant culture, my ability to be adaptive and solve problems, and confidence to make tough decisions.  These are all true.  I don't put up with bad attitudes at work, and always lead by example.  I am not an office manager, I am always on the floor with my team working to get things done.  I'll often jump between different positions in the store to help whoever needs it.  I also always want to practice honesty and integrity.  For example, I do not close the restaurant early.  If our doors stay that we are open until 9PM and someone walks in at 8:59, we are serving them no questions asked.  \n\nFor weaknesses, I still struggle with doing the back office work when it comes to running numbers and formulas.  Like for example if I have to calculate food costs or labor, or something else that requires a calculator.  Once I have the numbers I am great at putting things together and analyzing them to make decisions, but it will take me longer to come up with them on the fly.  One recruiter told me to spin this to say that I am much stronger as an operational leader working alongside the team, than an administrative one.\n\nI am looking for a salary of $60-65k base, with benefits and bonuses if possible.  I was at $60k at my last job, but they didn't have a bonus structure set up since they were so small.  I have completely open availability as my spouse stays at home with my child.  I would like to keep my hours at 55 a week or lower if possible, and about a 30 minute commute.  I have not found much within that 30 minutes though, with most places having me drive at least 30, 40, or even 60 minutes.  Most places fit within that salary range, so that hasn't been too much of a problem to negotiate.  \n\nI am starting to get really discouraged.  I already deal with depression and anxiety, and the rejection is getting to me.  Especially since I get no feedback on what I did wrong.  I don't want to sound narcissistic, but I have been told by everyone that I've worked with that I am an amazing boss.  I always put the team before myself when it comes to their needs.  I'll get their breaks out first, if I have to make labor cuts I will take on multiple jobs to ease the stress off of the rest of the team, and generally just be approachable to talk to.  I listen to the team and take their concerns to heart.  Now, this may not jive well with the upper management, but I still can manage to hit my goals they set out for me most of the time.  \n\nSo any advice you can give me is appreciated.
