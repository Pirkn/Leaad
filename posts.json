Score: 4 | Comment: Working at a company that builds AI agents and workflows, the manual narrative creation problem you mentioned is exactly what kills most reporting processes and honestly, most business intelligence tools completely ignore the \"so what\" question that executives actually need answered.\n\nThe automation I'd kill for is dynamic variance analysis that automatically identifies why metrics changed and provides business context. Not just \"sales dropped 15%\" but \"sales dropped 15% primarily due to delayed enterprise deals in Q4, with SMB segment actually growing 8% despite seasonal trends.\"\n\nFor narrative generation to work, the tool would need deep understanding of your business model, seasonal patterns, competitive landscape, and internal terminology. Generic \"insights\" are useless because they lack the business context that makes analysis actionable.\n\nThe trust factor comes from the system learning your company's specific reporting language and decision frameworks. If it can recognize that a 5% revenue dip in your SaaS business during January is normal but the same dip in March indicates a real problem, then it becomes valuable.\n\nMost automation tools are either too basic for real business intelligence or way too complex for everyday reporting workflows. The sweet spot is AI that understands your business metrics deeply enough to provide contextual analysis instead of just describing charts.\n\nI'd want the system to connect multiple data sources automatically and identify correlation patterns that human analysts miss. Like connecting customer support ticket volume to churn metrics to product release dates without manual analysis.\n\nThe key is making insights specific to your business instead of generic observations that any dashboard could provide.\n3.

Score: 28 | Comment: AI is a buzz word that company decision makers are just throwing around at the moment.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, AI will definitely be a big part of society and it is probably going to be the biggest change since the internet.  However, it is not there yet and many people need to understand data literacy better to fully grasp how AI can help.  Basically, what the intended use for the end stakeholders is to simply ask questions on a type of AI interface based on the database.  However, first the database has to be really clean in order for it to be accurate.  For most companies, that is rarely the case.  So you will still need people to clean the data before being loaded in.  AI may be able to do that someday but it can\u2019t right now, at least effectively.  Second, the executives still need to be able to understand the context behind the data and how to prompt AI.  I do not have confidence the majority of executives are comfortable in being able to do that.  Maybe the ones who are more data-inclined can do it, but that is not most executives.  Data analysts will still be needed for at least for the near future, depending on how fast AI progresses\n2.

Sure, I wouldn't use chatgpt to write articles for me from a simple prompt, but I will 100% use the custom thought leadership agent I built for clients to generate copy because that's exactly what it was trained to do. It's been trained to conduct in depth interviews and then generate long form content in the companies tone of voice.\n\nChatgpt, Gemini, Claude or any other LLMs aren't what's going to be taking people's jobs. It's the custom agents that are built on top of the LLMs that will be taking people's jobs. I'm currently working with a client on a custom agent that is driven by structured datasets pulled from all their business systems. CRM, xero, MailChimp, OneDrive + office data is all fed to a SQL database and used by the agent as it's data stores. The business owner can now ask it real time questions on processes and procedures and it helps to improve operations. On our end, we are monitoring the questions and answers coming back from the agent to drive the future development. \n\nThese agents can now trigger webhooks and invoke functions so once trained you can set them to automate digital processes and this is what's replacing humans.\n==============================", "\n            === POST 85 ===\n            Title: Is it appropriate to do outreach on WhatsApp?\n            Score: 0 upvotes\n            Total Comments: 30\n            URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1mlk4ps/\n            Content: I'm interested to hear your views.\n\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        1.

With limited capital, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to prioritize my efforts.\n\nOn one hand, I need to focus on sales to generate cash flow. On the other hand, I know brand building and marketing are crucial for long-term success. The problem is, I don\u2019t have the budget to fully commit to all areas at once.\n\nHow do you approach this balance?\n\n* Do you put most resources into immediate sales and build the brand later?\n* Or do you try to invest in both at a smaller scale?\n* Any tips for achieving mass-market reach without burning through limited funds?\n\nWould love to hear from those who\u2019ve been in the same situation.\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        1.
