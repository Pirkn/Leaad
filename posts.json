In the end, you spend your own time how you choose, and have to live with whatever consequence follows your action.

Or, you decide to go to the party even if you're not really in the mood, but it's great and you have so much fun with all kinds of people new and old, and wake up the next day with a new romance.

You could use those with something like NoCodeDB (self-hosted has unlimited rows) or [Teable.io](http://Teable.io) (self-hosted or cloud Pro has 1mill rows for $10/mo) for visualization.

Every jingle is reviewed and refined by people with real music experience (writers, producers, etc.) to make sure it actually slaps and fits the brand.\n\nWe\u2019re using cold email campaigns to reach niche markets like:\n\t\u2022\tDentists\n\t\u2022\tAuto repair shops\n\t\u2022\tReal estate agents\n\t\u2022\tBasically any small biz that wants to stand out\n\nInstead of the traditional $10,000+ jingle agency pricing, we start at $250.\n\nCurious what y\u2019all think about this:\n\t\u2022\tIs there a real need for this in 2025?\n\t\u2022\tWould small businesses buy in?\n\t\u2022\tAny sectors we should be targeting?\n\t\u2022\tIs the price fair?\n\nAppreciate any honest feedback \u2014 even if you roast it a little. | \nGETJINGLEJUICE.COM\n\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        1. Score: 1 | Comment: I don't think there's a market for it. Pretty cool concept though. The issue with low-cost products, is that they need a massive audience/appeal to make up for it. Consumer-targeted AI is still in its bad sentiment phase, and the \"jingle market\" is already miniscule. So you've got the most closed needle to thread. \n\nCool that you put all of this together though. Hope you win anyways\n2.

It's kind of a donut hole problem. The companies who want a $10k jingle might not be happy with the AI jingle. A small business who hasn't had a jingle might be ok with an AI jingle but might not want to spend $250. My wife's business is in the latter category and I already know $250 from her small marketing budget would be a non starter for her.\n\nAnyway I think it's interesting and wish you the best.\n==============================", "\n            === POST 96 ===\n            Title: Looking for a Sales/Lead Gen Partner \u2013 Let\u2019s Team Up\n            Score: 1 upvotes\n            Total Comments: 0\n            URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1mk5uu1/\n            Content: I am Full stack Developer (PHP/Laravel + frontend) with over 4 years of experience building custom websites, SaaS tools, and automation systems.

There are ultrasound/boutique businesses already, but I think they can be operated better, and I think the party room actively increases the value of the business and that value to the client. Let me explain:\n\nThe only material cost that the room would cost to me would be floor space and the initial cost of furnishing it. With smart purchases, you can outfit the room with themed posters (create from scratch double-sided posters, one for a boy theme, one for a girl), lighting, staging area, rugs, etc., to suit a variety of cases. My anticipated use cases would be gender reveal parties and baby showers. I could also hire local teachers to give free classes to new parents.\n\nThis adds value to the business in a var\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        ==============================", "\n            === POST 99 ===\n            Title: Going viral is overrated.

For months, growth was painfully slow. Just a trickle of new users and a dashboard that barely moved. I used to stress out watching everyone online blow up overnight, but here\u2019s the thing: I still got to $10k MRR, and it had nothing to do with hacks or chasing virality.\n\nWhat actually worked was consistently showing up where my users spend time, helping them out, and listening to feedback even when it was just a few loyal customers nitpicking the app. I kept answering questions, fixing bugs, and writing useful guides. Cold emails flopped, paid ads went nowhere, and trying to look viral was a waste. But those small, real connections slowly turned into word-of-mouth growth, and it finally started compounding.\n\nSo yeah, if you\u2019re not viral, screw it. Embrace being boring as hell. Most of those viral legends are gone in six months anyway. And honestly, nothing feels better than actually lasting.\n\nAnyone else here building sl\n\n            TOP COMMENTS:\n        1.
