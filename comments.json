[{"6": "It's definitely tricky when you're trying to pivot or get into a field without direct experience, especially with finance internships. What really helped me when I was in a similar spot was focusing on how my existing skills, even if from a different context, delivered results. Think about those customer-facing roles \u2013 how did you solve problems, manage expectations, or even handle money? Those can be reframed into valuable analytical or client management skills. For the ATS part, making sure your resume formatting is super clean and uses keywords from job descriptions can make a huge difference. Sometimes using a platform like Cv Maker or something similar can help ensure it's structured well for those systems without you having to stress about the nitty-gritty design elements, allowing you to focus on the content. It\u2019s all about translating what you\u2019ve done into what they need."}, {"3": "That's a really solid start for a resume summary, you've definitely captured some key strengths there! When I was refining my own, I found it helped to make it super concise and impactful. Instead of 'known for reliable performance,' maybe something like 'consistently deliver reliable performance' \u2013 it just sounds a bit more active. Also, try to think about what unique angle you bring. If you have a strong understanding of restaurant operations, maybe lead with that. It differentiates you more than general 'hard-working' phrases. You want to give them the strongest hook right away, so they immediately see you as a great fit for a serving position. Some tools out there like Resume.io or Cv Maker can actually give you good examples of punchy summary sections that keep it brief and to the point while highlighting your best qualities."}, {"4": "Applying to 200 jobs without an interview is incredibly frustrating, especially with a strong academic background like yours. It often comes down to how your skills and projects are being presented and if they're truly resonating with the ATS and then the hiring manager for those specific analyst or engineering roles. For technical positions, sometimes the way you describe your projects and the specific technologies you used needs to be highly tailored to each job description, almost like you're speaking their language directly. It's not just about what you did, but the impact and the tools involved. Sometimes platforms like Rezi or Cv Maker can help with optimizing for ATS and ensuring a clean, readable format that highlights those technical details effectively."}, {"15": "Breaking into pharma/biotech as a new grad, especially abroad, can feel like a maze. Your background in Molecular Biomedical Sciences and lab techniques is a great foundation, but it's really about how you frame that academic experience for industry roles. For entry-level, look hard at Junior CRA, Lab Technician, or even certain R&D support roles. These often value your hands-on lab skills and your understanding of scientific principles. When you're structuring your CV, emphasize the *results* of your lab work or master's projects, even if it's academic. Did you optimize a protocol? Analyze a dataset that led to a specific conclusion? Quantify anything you can. For the European market, precision in your CV formatting and content is super important, as companies there often have specific expectations. Tools like Cv Maker or similar platforms can be useful to ensure your CV is professionally laid out and easy to read, which definitely helps when applying across different countries."}, {"53": "It's completely understandable to feel that way about your resume when trying to shift to a temporary retail job, especially with a strong academic background. You definitely don't need to lie about your experience. Instead, focus on re-framing it. For a retail role, emphasize customer service, problem-solving, teamwork, and any administrative skills you picked up, no matter where. Your college education isn't a gap, it's a huge asset that shows you're disciplined and can learn quickly. Think about how your management experience, even if in fast food, developed leadership, inventory management, or customer interaction skills \u2013 these are all highly valuable in retail. When you're making a resume for this kind of temporary work, sometimes using a simpler, very clear template from a service like Resume.io or Cv Maker can help you streamline it so it highlights just the most relevant skills without going into excessive detail that might make it seem like you're overqualified."}]
