[{"13": "It's completely understandable to feel resource-constrained when starting. A common approach for early validation without much tech is to focus on getting a clear signal from your target users. Instead of a full website, consider building a simple landing page that clearly articulates the problem you're solving and how your future solution might help. It's an effective way to gauge interest and collect emails from potential early adopters. Tools like Carrd or even some no-code waitlist platforms can help you set this up quickly and for free or low cost, allowing you to validate demand before investing heavily in development."}, {"21": "This is a great way to approach product validation \u2013 directly asking your target audience for their thoughts. For convenience, it really comes down to the friction of adding it yourself. If it's a powder that clumps or requires stirring, then pre-mixed convenience has a clear value. As for branding, 'lifestyle' often has broader appeal beyond specific niches like 'gym performance,' especially if you're trying to reach regular coffee drinkers. To truly test this, setting up a simple landing page to gauge interest and collect emails from hypothetical buyers could give you more concrete data on which messaging resonates more. You could even use it to ask for their preferred branding style directly."}, {"34": "This is a common hurdle when building a SaaS \u2013 figuring out what problem to solve. Instead of starting with 'what AI SaaS to make,' try flipping it to 'what problems can AI help solve for a specific group of people?' Deep dive into a niche you understand or are interested in. Talk to potential users, listen to their frustrations, and see if AI can offer a unique or significantly better solution than existing ones. You might find overlooked pain points where even a micro-SaaS can have a huge impact. Once you identify a problem, you can then build a super simple MVP, perhaps even just a landing page to see if people are interested in your proposed solution before you build out all the AI tech."}, {"63": "This is a tough spot to be in \u2013 trying to generate buzz for something that isn't fully defined or available yet. Your instinct to get guest blogs sorted is good, as is the idea of a waiting list. When you don't have a product, you're selling the *promise* and the *future value*. Focus on the problem your membership will solve. Can you create content (even just blog posts if management allows, or external articles) that talks about the pain points your target audience experiences, and subtly hint at a future solution? A strong waitlist page that clearly explains the upcoming value and allows people to sign up for early access or updates can be very effective. There are tools like Squarespace, Leadpages, or no-code waitlist platforms like Waitlists Now that are designed to help you set up a professional-looking page quickly, even with minimal content, to capture early interest. This gives you a tangible asset to point people towards, rather than just an empty website."}, {"82": "Great question to ask *before* diving in! To truly gauge demand for a local service, start with low-cost validation. Talk to people in your target demographic (new movers, small businesses, etc.) \u2013 what are their current pain points with moving or transport? Are they using existing services, and if so, what do they like/dislike? You could also set up a basic landing page describing your proposed service and offering a 'notify me when launched' or 'get a quote' option to see how many sign-ups you get. This helps you collect real interest and contact info without a huge upfront investment. It also helps you understand pricing expectations and service specifics."}]
