[{"44": "It's smart to look for skilled promoters on platforms like Reddit. For SaaS products, the key isn't just broad promotion but finding specific communities where your target users are actively discussing problems your product solves. A lot of success comes from genuinely engaging in those conversations, offering helpful advice, and only then, if perfectly aligned, mentioning your solution as one of several viable options. Tools exist to help identify these 'high-intent' conversations where people are expressing a need, making outreach much more efficient and less 'salesy' \u2013 almost like an early warning system for relevant discussions. It's a different approach than just posting ads; it's about being part of the solution in relevant discussions."}, {"85": "This is a great challenge, and it sounds like you've got a solid product with some early traction! Your intuition about needing to go beyond just posting in niche subreddits is spot on. For positioning, focus heavily on the *outcome* \u2013 what problems does not having StrideSync create? Maybe it's about missing trends in training, inability to easily share progress with a coach, or simply the time wasted on manual data handling. For reaching beyond the obvious crowd, think about where people discuss data management, personal analytics, or even simple goal tracking that isn't fitness-specific. There are tools that can help with monitoring discussions on platforms like Reddit for 'intent' \u2013 basically, finding people who are talking about the *problems* your product solves, even if they don't know your product exists or aren't explicitly searching for a 'Strava integration'. This allows you to jump into conversations where you can genuinely offer value first. When it comes to the Google Sheets angle, lean into it! Many people love the control and flexibility of Sheets. Position it as the ultimate customizable dashboard for their activities, putting them in control of their data without being tied to a specific app's limitations. Perhaps even create templates for common goals (e.g., 'Marathon Training Progress Tracker' using StrideSync data)."}, {"21": "It's a common challenge for B2B SaaS companies, even with early traction and a solid product. Relying on Reddit and LinkedIn for initial customer acquisition, especially through content, is a strong start. The goal of shifting more revenue to marketing is understandable for scaling.\n\nSince Reddit is already a source for you, a deeper dive into how you're identifying those opportunities might be beneficial. Instead of just sharing content and waiting, actively finding discussions where businesses are expressing needs related to community building (e.g., 'struggling with engagement', 'how to foster a community around our product', 'need a platform for customer discussions') could accelerate your lead gen. There are solutions that help monitor Reddit for these specific problem-oriented conversations, providing a stream of relevant leads and even AI-assisted response generation to help you craft helpful, non-promotional replies quickly. This proactive engagement, combined with your existing content strategy, could significantly boost your 'approach us' rate and improve your demo-to-customer conversion by reaching people who are already primed with a need."}, {"91": "It's totally practical to imagine scaling your SaaS with a strong organic growth component, especially if your current customer base is already coming from Reddit and LinkedIn. The 1-2 customers from 10-15 demos suggests your conversion rate could be optimized, but the bigger lever for growth will be increasing the volume of qualified demos.\n\nSince Reddit is already a successful channel for you, consider refining your approach there. Beyond just sharing content, focus on identifying specific users or businesses expressing pain points related to community building. This involves more than just keyword searches; it\u2019s about understanding the nuance of their problems. There are platforms designed to help you pinpoint these high-intent conversations on Reddit, providing a feed of potential leads based on expressed needs. Some even offer tools to help draft contextually relevant, helpful responses, allowing you to engage proactively and naturally, which can significantly increase the number of businesses approaching you for demos. This approach aligns well with your current organic strategy and can directly impact your 'approach us' rate, making your current marketing efforts even more efficient."}]
