[{"25": "It's brilliant that you've distilled best practices into actionable questions for idea validation. Truly understanding if there's a real problem and demand is crucial before committing time and resources. A great next step after these questions is getting early market interest. For that, tools like WaitlistNow can be really helpful; they let you quickly set up a professional waitlist page to gather early sign-ups and validate interest without any coding."}, {"36": "Validating an idea before building is key. You're spot on that getting people to commit (even if it's just an email) is far more telling than just general interest. A common approach is to create a simple landing page that explains your idea and asks for an email sign-up if people are interested. This acts as a 'pre-order' for interest. WaitlistNow is a fantastic tool for this; it lets you build professional waitlist pages quickly to gauge actual market demand and collect early sign-ups without needing to code anything."}, {"39": "It's smart to seek validation before diving deep! For a platform like yours, getting early interest and feedback from potential users (writers, screenwriters, filmmakers) is vital. Beyond just qualitative feedback, collecting early sign-ups on a dedicated page can show genuine commitment. You can quickly set up a waitlist page outlining your vision and allow interested creators to sign up. WaitlistNow is a great no-code option for creating professional, customizable waitlist pages and tracking early interest effectively."}, {"49": "It's super smart to get feedback before building! For an app like this, which combines so many features, validating interest for the overall concept and specific features is crucial. Before you even think about building, try putting up a simple landing page explaining your idea and what problems it solves. Then, ask people to sign up if they're interested in getting early access or updates. This gives you concrete data on demand. WaitlistNow is perfect for creating these kinds of waitlist pages quickly and painlessly, allowing you to gauge real interest without writing a single line of code."}]
